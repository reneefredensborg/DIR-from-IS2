# Estimation of degree of sea ice ridging in the Bay of Bothnia based on geolocated photon heights from ICESat-2
Contact: Renée Mie Fredensborg Hansen / renee.fredensborg.hansen@fmi.fi 

Code repository for producing an estimate of degree of sea ice ridging in the Bay of Bothnia using geolocated photon heights (ATL03) ICESat-2 data. The model code is written in the open source programming language Python (using JupyterNotebook). Main inputs needed for the DIR estimation, calculation and comparison is the ATL03 global geolocated photon heights from ICESat-2 data and ice charts (e.g. provided by FIS). This github repository is made to collect and show the scripts used in the study, but requires some data not publicly available (e.g. FIS ice charts). 

#### Versions 

v1.0: This initial repository was used to process ICESat-2 DIR estimates from the first winter season (spring 2019), based on ICESat-2 tracks with available data in the Bay of Bothnia (Baltic Sea) during this period. 

Some of the plots (e.g. distribution plots, and analysis hereof) was performed in R Studio.
